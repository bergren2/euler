Project Euler programs.

## What is this?

I use this repository to track solutions I have come up with for [Project Euler
problems](https://projecteuler.net/problems). They are kept in the `solutions`
directory and each file name matches the corresponding problem ID.

I know this goes without saying, but **these are solutions**. You should really
take a stab at the problems themselves before looking at this code.

## What language are you using?

I originally intended to use Project Euler as a way to learn new languages. But
after sitting on that strategy for some time and seeing how it worked as the
problems became more difficult, I realized I'm better off using one language
_really, really_ well and learnings its ins-and-outs.

For this project, I'm sticking with Ruby. If you're interested in learning Ruby
as well, I highly recommend reading David A. Black's [The Well-Grounded
Rubyist](http://www.manning.com/black3/) since it will give you the tools you
need to tackle Project Euler problems.

## Tests

Since this is an ongoing project, I wanted to be able to safely refactor without
needing to constantly refer to the Project Euler website. Hence, unit tests!
