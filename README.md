# Project Euler

Project Euler programs.

## What is this?

I use this repository to track solutions I have come up with for [Project Euler
problems](https://projecteuler.net/problems). They are kept in the `solutions`
directory and each file name matches the corresponding problem ID.

I know this goes without saying, but **these are solutions**. You should really
take a stab at the problems themselves before looking at this code.
