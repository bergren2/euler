## What is this?

I use this repository to track solutions I have come up with for [Project Euler
problems](https://projecteuler.net/problems). They are kept in the `solutions`
directory and each file name matches the corresponding problem ID.

I know this goes without saying, but **these are solutions**. You should really
take a stab at the problems themselves before looking at this code.

## Why the different languages?

I'm always trying to learn new languages; Project Euler is a great way to make
sure I understand the intricacies of each one. Currently problems are solved by
whichever language I felt like using at the time, but eventually I'd like to
come up with multiple language solutions for each problem.
